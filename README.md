# EmployeeApp


This is a referential project and is in an early stage.
A lot still need to be added.

Purpose is to setup a microservice architecture:
- Containers
..* ASP.NET Core api
..* node.js
..* Haskell 
..* OCAML
..* F#
..* Ruby 
..* C++
- Frontend
..* angular2
..* elm
..* ember

I will create issues for the things that are coming up.
